Hello, and welcome to our chat app!

This is a chat messaging app which you can use to communicate with your friends.
The app was built as part of "Advanced Programming 2" course in Bar-Ilan Univesity.

In order to run the app you can clone the project and run "npm install" in the cmd line,
from the directory that contains the project files. we used react-router-dom and 
react-bootstrap, so you might want to  install them before using the app by the command
"npm install" + the name of those two libraries. 

As you run it a login page will appear, and then:
	- if you're already registered type in your username and password
	- otherwise, click on the link below and move on to register page,
	  and follow the instructions: fill username, password, nickname and add a profile picture

After that you will see the Chat screen:
in the left side your contacts will be displayed, and all you need to do is to click
on the contact you like and start chat with him.
In our application you can send him a text message, picture, video, and even a recording
by click on the paper clip icon.

We made an example for you, so you can type in the username box "kermit",
and in the password box "kermit1".

We wish you enjoy your time in the app :)
